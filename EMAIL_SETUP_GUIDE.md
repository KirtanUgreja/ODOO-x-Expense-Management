4. Click **Generate**
5. **Copy the 16-character password** (spaces will be removed automatically)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
1. Open your `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace these values with your actual Gmail credentials:

```bash
SMTP_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
SMTP_FROM="ExpenseFlow Notifications" <your-actual-email@gmail.com>
```

# .env.local
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=john.doe@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
SMTP_FROM="ExpenseFlow Notifications" <john.doe@gmail.com>
EMAIL_DEBUG=true
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication Failed" Error
- âœ… Verify 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account
- âœ… Use App Password, not your regular Gmail password
- âœ… Double-check the Gmail address is correct
- âœ… Generate a new App Password if needed

### "Connection Timeout" Error
- âœ… Check your internet connection
- âœ… Disable VPN/proxy temporarily
- âœ… Verify firewall settings aren't blocking port 587

### "Certificate Error"
- âœ… This is usually temporary - try again in a few minutes
- âœ… Check if Gmail is experiencing outages

### Email Not Received
- âœ… Check spam/junk folder
- âœ… Verify the recipient email address is correct
- âœ… Check Gmail sending limits (500 emails/day for regular accounts)
- âœ… Ensure your Gmail account isn't suspended

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env.local` file** to version control
- **Use App Passwords** instead of your main Gmail password
- **Keep your App Passwords secure** and regenerate them if compromised
- **Monitor your Gmail account** for suspicious activity

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Enable debug mode** by setting `EMAIL_DEBUG=true` in `.env.local`
3. **Test the SMTP connection** using the built-in tester in the admin panel
4. **Verify your Gmail account** is in good standing and not limited

## Alternative: EmailJS

If Gmail SMTP doesn't work for you, consider using EmailJS as an alternative:

1. Create account at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Set up email service and templates
3. Configure the EmailJS environment variables in `.env.local`

Both methods are supported by ExpenseFlow!
